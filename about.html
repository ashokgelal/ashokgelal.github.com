  <p>By day, I ship code at <a href="http://metageek.net">MetaGeek</a>, by night, I hack on my personal projects, and finally, when I get some off time in between, I also serve as a CTO for <a href="http://clockworkengine.com">ClockworkEngine, LLC</a> where so far we have launched two products - <a href="http://clockworkengine.com">Spyglass</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clockworkengine.android.LightPaper">LightPaper</a>. Call be a serial coder if you want.</p>

  <p>I spent few years writing web apps then I switched to writing desktop apps at MetaGeek, and now I'm inclined towards writing mobile apps. I've used PHP, C#, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C on various projects. I throw away most of what I code but some of them sometimes make their way to my <a href="http://github.com/ashokgelal">GitHub account</a>.</p>
  

  <p>This should be obvious but, unless otherwise quoted, the ideas/feelings/opinions expressed in this blog are my own and not of anyone else.</p>
