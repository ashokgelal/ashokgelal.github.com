If you are like me who often likes to test one of the thousand applications available for Ubuntu and like to keep track of whatever you install or remove, here is a script for you. This script, _tapt_, tweets whatever you install, remove or perform other operations with _'apt-get'_ in Ubuntu to your Tweeter account.
