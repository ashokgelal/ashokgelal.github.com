Esp. if you are working with MonoDevelop+Gtk#. Believe me it is more painful than getting your balls pinched by someone. I never had this experience (getting the balls pinched) but yes couple of times I've been hit with cricket balls, and today's experience with refactoring/ renaming namespaces was more painful than those hits.
