Yay!
After working my ass off for two days, I finally finished porting CoreWLANWirelessManager sample from Apple's Official Reference Library (http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/CoreWLANWirelessManager/History/History.html) to MonoMac. This was my first time working with Cocoa+MonoMac, and the experience wasn't that bad. As I was trying to mimic the behavior, naming convention, and style of the official sample, it took me more time than expected. Nevertheless, the coding was a breeze - only couple of times I got stuck. During this time, I was also able to find a bug in MonoMac related to some threading issue (my guess).
Anyways, it feels super awesome to finish a Mac Application in a language that I love (C#) and then distribute the source code for the open source lovers to play, and learn from it. The source code is hosted on github: [https://github.com/ashokgelal/CoreWLANWirelessManager](https://github.com/ashokgelal/CoreWLANWirelessManager)
