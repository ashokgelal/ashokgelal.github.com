Designers know the pain of managing fonts in any OS. Without a font manager, previewing each fonts and than copying them to the fonts folder is very cumbersome. There are no. of font manager available for Windows such as [AMP Font Viewer](http://www.ampsoft.net/utilities/FontViewer.php), [Fontonizer](http://www.fontonizer.com/). Managing fonts in Linux OS is lot more pain. Most of the users don't know where to copy the fonts. The equivalent of _C:WindowsFonts_ in Linux is _/user/share/fonts_. Now with _Fontmatrix_ the pain of managing fonts are gone.

[Fontmatrix](http://fontmatrix.net/) is a font manager just like other font managers for Windows but it has some new professional features. One of the very appreciating features is the concept of 'tagging'. You can tag a font for easy grouping and sub-grouping. Such as you can tag a font with keywords such as _magazine_, _website_, _book_ etc. This will allow you to find easily which fonts you are using in a magazine and then export all the fonts tagged as magazine for instance. Besides tagging, fontmatrix can show all glyphs in a font, previews of sample text, variable sizing and also tells what kinds of advanced Open Type features are inside each font. You can import a directory containing fonts for previewing and installing them with an ease. Export font book menu allows you to create a nice PDF catalogue of user's fonts for printing or reference.
