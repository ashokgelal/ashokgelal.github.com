[Light Paper](http://getlightpaper.com) is a distraction-free editor made specifically for Android. With love, of course.

It supports Markdown, has easily accessible quick Markdown shortcut codes, syncs to cloud, has a distraction-free writing mode, preview is one swipe away, and is optimized for different screen sizes.

<del>It'll be out in few weeks. [Sign up now](http://getlightpaper.com) to be one of the first few to have it when it is out.</del>

[It's out and available on the Google Play Store][1]!
